# NewCollegeCS.github.io

Right now this is just a barebones template. I'm using a freenom domain and
hosting the page using github pages, so everything is free as of now. The page 
is limited to being completely static using these resources.

Images are free and come from pexels.com.

#TODO

* Get a real domain
* Get hosting that allows JS, Python, etc.
* Add some real content and functionality
* Email records probably
